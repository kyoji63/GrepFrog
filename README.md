"grepfrog" is a command that aggregates file modification commands.<br>



I will gradually add more functions...

# Usage

The standard function is based on the grep command, which replaces the searched string with the string "frog".<br>

```sh
$ grepfrog -h
grepfrog <COMMON_OPTIONS> [FILE]
COMMON_OPTIONS
    -c, -change <String1> <String2>   Change <String1> to <String2> in the file.
    -e, -encode <String>              Encode to the specified character set.
    -h, -help                         Prints this message.

```
